This chart starts a Bucardo replication based on the configuration provided into the values.yaml
Some hacks are needed to allow Bucardo to operate, so the chart deploy a pod that do some magics about source database:
* create primary key for table that not provide one
* a preStopHook to clean the bucardo schema and removing the auto-generated primary keys

stop the replication with:

helm -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} uninstall {{ .Release.Name }}

Comments, ideas and critics are welcome ;)

Happy helming!
